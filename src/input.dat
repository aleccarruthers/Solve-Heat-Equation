# 1D and 2D Heat Conduction Input File

# Number of Nodes: For 2D, if the input number of nodes does not have a perfect square, the input
# nodes will be used as the number of nodes in both the x and y direction, i.e. inputing 15 would
# lead to a domain with 225 total nodes (15 x 15). Entering 400, would create a domain of size 
# 20 x 20
nodes = 10

# Supported Solvers: 'GS' for Gauss-Seidel, 'Jacobi' for Jacobi, or 'petsc' for PETSc solver
solver = petsc

# Supported Dimensions: 1 or 2		
dimension = 2

# Supported Finite Differencing Orders: 2 (both solvers) or 4 (only Gauss-Seidel)
finorder = 4

# Verification Mode (t: verification, f: standard)
verification = t

# Log-Level ('standard': standard output, 'debug': debug mode)
# 'standard' has 3 output sections: inputs, the computed normalized error, and performance metrics
# 'debug': Same three outputs along with the A matrix, the MASA source vector, and grid indices printed
loglevel = standard

# Maximum number of iterations for numerical solver (default: 250000)
# INPUT must be an integer with no special characters
max_iterations = 250000

# Suggested and Default Inputs (Please keep these as the default for this iteration of the code.)
